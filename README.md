# external-link-indicator

an chrome extension adding icons to indicate links opened in new tab

## what is it?

dont how many times i click a link and get myself navigated off from the current page, witch i wanna stay.
of course i can force every link opened in new tab by holding the `Ctrl/âŒ˜`, but if i know the link got a `target="_blank"` attribute i can sure it will open in new tab and there's no necessary by forcing it to.

this extension mark links with an icon to indicate wheter it will be opened in new tab.
